This React project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It displays a welcome screen and provides options to sign up for the newsletter, submit a service ticket, or create an account with vehicle details.

## Scripts

The color theme is black and gold and styles are defined in `src/index.css` and `src/App.css`.
